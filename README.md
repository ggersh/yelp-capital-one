My winning work for the Capital One Summit for Software Engineers coding challenge, part 2 of their application for their Summit for Software Engineers.

This repository contains my submission for Capital One's Summit for Software Engineers. As part of the final round application for this program, applicants were instructed to complete a coding challenge in which applicants were to make an app implementing the yelp fusion API to help users pick a restaurant and experience.

# Run Time

One of the most crucial things a runner must do after a run is to eat as soon as possible to replenish energy loss to kick-start the restoring process to help build, maintain, and replenish muscle. It is recommended that the runner must eat within 20-30 minutes after a run to get the best results in utilizing glycogen, protein, and electrolytes to maximize recovery.

Many times runners often don’t have time to plan ahead and pack food for when they are done running, in order to properly refuel right after a run. To fix this, runners often choose to run to restaurants, but have a hard time finding restaurants that are the proper distance for their run.

Runtime is an app built with the yelp fusion API that takes in the user’s favorite food, information, and their fastest mile time to determine which restaurants fit the user best. This app also lets the user see how long the run will take from their current position and how far the run will be. This allows the user to ensure that they intake the proper nutrients directly after a run with their favorite food and preferred distance.

# How to run

User must install flask

User may also need get API key from yelp fusion API and put in fusionAPI.py file

First if using python 2.7 or lower install the virtualenv package and setup a virtualenv in the project root

# python3 has it preinstalled
$ pip install virtualenv

# for python 2.7
$ virtualenv venv

# for python 3+
$ python -m venv venv

# then activate it

# on linux or mac
$ source venv/bin/activate

# on windows 
$ . venv\Scripts\activate.bat

Run: “pip install -r requirements.txt” in terminal

Steps to run app:

1. Run flaskApp.py file
2. Navigate to 127.0.0.1:5000
